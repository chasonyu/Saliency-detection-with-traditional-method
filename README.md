# Saliency-detection-with-traditional-method

This repository is about Saliecny detection with traditional methods,including LC,HC,AC and FT.

These methods didn't use deep learning,their realization are all in traditional feature extraction.

This repository will achieve these methods with Java and OpenCV,the implements are as follows:

   Language: Java
   JDK: 1.8
